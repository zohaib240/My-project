    You are proud as a master poet, <br>
Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect,<br>
Verse and prose comes from you imaginative wit,<br>
Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit. <br>
<br>
One sadden moment I read your poetry,<br>
Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary, <br>
What a wonderful legendary poem story created <br>
Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly, <br>
<br>
A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue, <br> 
Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be, <br>
Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece, <br>
Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence. <br>
<br>
Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out, <br>
Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt, <br>
Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust, <br>
Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet. <br>
